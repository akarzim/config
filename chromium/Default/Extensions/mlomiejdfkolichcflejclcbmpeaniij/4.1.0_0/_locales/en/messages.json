DETECT: Ghostery sees the \"invisible\" web, detecting trackers, web bugs, pixels, and beacons placed on web pages by Facebook, Google Analytics, and over 500 other ad networks, behavioral data providers, web publishers - all companies interested in your activity. LEARN: After showing you who operates behind the scenes, Ghostery also gives you the opportunity to learn more about each company it identifies, including links to their privacy policy and opt-out options. CONTROL: Ghostery allows you to block page elements from companies that you don't trust. COLLABORATE: Ghostery also includes the optional, opt-in feature called GhostRank, which sends Ghostery servers anonymous information about the trackers you encounter and where you encounter them.  This helps us improve and support Ghostery. More information in our FAQ.  PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY: Ghostery is built and maintained for users that care about their online privacy, and is engineered with privacy as a primary goal.  Ghostery use is anonymous. No registrations or sign-ups are required. The Ghostery plug-in does not place session cookies into your browser. Neither the Ghostery application nor Evidon receives any data from Ghostery users unless the user opts-in to participate in GhostRank. GhostRank data is anonymous, it is NEVER used for advertising targeting purposes, and is only shared in an aggregated, non-personal, statistical form.
