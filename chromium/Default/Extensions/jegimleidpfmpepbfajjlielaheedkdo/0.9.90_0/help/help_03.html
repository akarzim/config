	<h2>Changing colors</h2>
  <p>Walk around the current web page with your mouse pointer to highlight the desired element of the document that should be explored / modified.</p>
  <p>Clicking on that element activates the 'DOM Color-Explorer' to choose between some options like foreground, background, etc. and to explore the position in the DOM and to choose those elements for exploring / changing. (Highlighting stays for 2 sec.)<br>
  In this new version it's also possile to choose a  tag that is used in the current document and change its CSS rule.<br>
  The switch '!imp' makes that rule stronger so it might be able to overwrite a tag's rule even if there is a class attached.</p>
  <p>Use the colorPicker to make changes on the element's color.</p>
  <p>Clicking or the spy glass hides the 'DOM Color-Explorer' and makes the colorPicker inactive.<br>
    Use the 'Esc' key or click on the 'x' in the right top corner of the colorPicker to turn <strong>off</strong> the extension.<br>
  The 'DOM Color-Explorer' is also draggable.</p>
